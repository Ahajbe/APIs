		<tr>
			<td>showAllMatchingCategories</td>
			<td>Control whether or not this query will return all matching categories, regardless of relevance. When performing a keyword search, the Shopping.com API will normally return 0 or more matching categories up to a relevance threshold. This means that even if the search engine finds 100 categories matching the keyword, it may only return a fraction of those if it determines that the remaining categories are outside of the relevance threshold. Setting the numCategories parameter to 100 will not change this behavior, as numCategories is overruled by relevance thresholds.<br/>                            If you would like to see all matching categories (sorted alphabetically), regardless of relevance thresholds, use the showAllMatchingCategories parameter. Keep in mind, however, that due to the large number of categories normally returned, the API will not return items per category for this type of result. If, on the other hand, your keyword search has skipped to a single category, and you would simply like to see results from more than that one category (still subject to relevance thresholds), use the doSkipping parameter instead.<br/>                       </td>

By default, the API will return 0 attributes, which can be changed by using this parameter. However, any attributes above 5 will not include values unless you also set the numAttributesWithValues parameter.
