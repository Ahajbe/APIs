<h3>picasa.user.album.media.post</h3>
<p>There are two ways to add a photo to an album using the Data API:<br/>Upload the binary image data along with its metadata. To do this, use MIME content type "multipart/related"; send photo metadata in one part of the POST body, and binary-encoded image data in another part. This is the preferred approach.<br/>Upload the binary image data without the metadata.<br/>While all photos appearing on the Picasa Web Albums site are in the JPEG format, photos of any of the following types can be uploaded using the API:<br/>- image/bmp<br/>- image/gif<br/>- image/jpeg<br/>- image/png<br/><br/>A video is posted in the same way as a photo with metadata (Note: You cannot submit a video without metadata at this time, you must use a MIME multipart). Instead of an image MIME type you have to use an appropriate video MIME type (refer to http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/picasaweb/docs/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#PostVideo).<br/>The recognized video MIME types are:<br/>- video/3gpp<br/>- video/avi<br/>- video/quicktime<br/>- video/mp4<br/>- video/mpeg<br/>- video/mpeg4<br/>- video/msvideo<br/>- video/x-ms-asf<br/>- video/x-ms-wmv<br/>- video/x-msvideo<br/>               </p>
