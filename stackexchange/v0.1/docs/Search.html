<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Search'</p><h3>search</h3>
<p>Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.<br/><br/>					This method is intentionally quite limited. For more general searching, you should use a proper internet search engine restricted to the domain of the site in question.<br/><br/>					At least one of tagged or intitle must be set on this method. nottagged is only used if tagged is also set, for performance reasons.<br/>			</p>
