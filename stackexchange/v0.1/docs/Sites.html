<h1>Stackexchange API: Sites</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Sites'</p><h3>sitesList</h3>
<p>Returns all sites in the network.<br/>		      <br/>		      This method allows for discovery of new sites, and changes to existing ones. Be aware that unlike normal API methods, this method should be fetched very infrequently, it is very unusual for these values to change more than once on any given day. It is suggested that you cache its return for at least one day, unless your app encounters evidence that it has changed (such as from the /info method).<br/>		      <br/>		      The pagesize parameter for this method is unbounded, in acknowledgement that for many applications repeatedly fetching from /sites would complicate start-up tasks needlessly.<br/>		      <br/>		      This method returns a list of sites.<br/>		   </p>
