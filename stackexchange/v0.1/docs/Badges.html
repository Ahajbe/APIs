<h1>Stackexchange API: Badges</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Badges'</p><h3>badgesList</h3>
<p>
					Returns all the badges in the system.

					Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.

					This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.

					For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver and min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.

					rank is the default sort.

					This method returns a list of badges.

<h3>badgesGet</h3>
<p>
					Gets the badges identified in id.

					Note that badge ids are not constant across sites, and thus should be looked up via the /badges method. A badge id on a single site is, however, guaranteed to be stable.

					Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.

					This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.

					For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver and min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.

					rank is the default sort.

					{ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for badge_id on badge objects.

					This method returns a list of badges.

<h3>namedBadgesList</h3>
<p>
					Gets all explicitly named badges in the system.

					A named badged stands in opposition to a tag-based badge. These are referred to as general badges on the sites themselves.

<h3>tagBadgesList</h3>
<p>
					Returns the badges that are awarded for participation in specific tags.

					Tag badges vary wildly between sites, and should not be assumed to correlate in any regard (such as id).
