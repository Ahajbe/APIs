<h1>Stackexchange API: Apps</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Apps'</p><h3>appsDeAuthenticateGet</h3>
<p>Passing valid access_tokens to this method causes the application that created them to be de-authorized by the user associated with each access_token. This will remove the application from their apps tab, and cause all other existing access_tokens to be destroyed.<br/>		      <br/>		      This method is meant for uninstalling applications, recovering from access_token leaks, or simply as a stronger form of /access-tokens/{accessTokens}/invalidate.<br/>		      <br/>		      Nothing prevents a user from re-authenticate to an application that has de-authenticated itself, the user will be prompted to approve the application again however.<br/>		   </p>
