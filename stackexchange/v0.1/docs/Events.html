<h1>Stackexchange API: Events</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Events'</p><h3>eventsList</h3>
<p>
					Returns a stream of events that have occurred on the site.

					The API considers the following "events":

					posting a question
					posting an answer
					posting a comment
					editing a post
					creating a user
					Events are only accessible for 15 minutes after they occurred, and by default only events in the last 5 minutes are returned. You can specify the age of the oldest event returned by setting the since parameter.

					It is advised that developers batch events by ids and make as few subsequent requests to other methods as possible.

					This method returns a list of events.
