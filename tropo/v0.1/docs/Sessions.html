<h1>Tropo API: Sessions</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Sessions'</p><h3>sessionStart</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to kick off an "outbound session" using a token and the REST API, which then launches the application, makes a call and plays a message. It will also show how to pass additional parameters into your application when initiating the Tropo Scripting session. To find your token, login to your Tropo account, display the application configuration screen, and look down under the phone numbers<br/>					<br/>			   </p>

<h3>sessionInterrupt</h3>
<p>Say you want to play some hold music, then interrupt it later. In order to interrupt, you would give a the say that's playing the hold music a signal using the allowSignals parameter. You can then make a web service call using that name and Tropo will stop running that function. If the function has already run and completed, your interrupt request will be ignored. If it has not run yet, it will be queued until the function runs.<br/><br/>					Note: transfer and conference must include the terminator parameter for signaling to work.<br/>					<br/>			   </p>
