<h3>addressAddtollfree</h3>
<p>This method will add a toll free number to the application, based on a specified prefix. This is essentially the same process as the one you would use to add a standard U.S. phone number , however you must already having billing setup for Tropo or you will receive a 400 response code, as all toll free numbers require a production account.<br/><br/>						Possible values include 855, 866, 877 and 888; if there are no available numbers with the prefix specified, you will receive a 503 response code, at which point you can try one of the other options.<br/>				   </p>

<h3>addressAddintl</h3>
<p>This method will add an international number, based on a specified country code prefix. Currently, you cannot select a specific area code prefix for International numbers, just the country code (so you can't select 31+20 for Amsterdam - you might get 31+10 for Rotterdam instead).<br/><br/>						If there are no available numbers with the prefix specified, you will receive a 503 response code.<br/>				   </p>

<h3>addressAddspecific</h3>
<p>The ability to add a specific number is really only used when you need to move a number from one application to another. You would use this method on the destination application - the one where you want the phone number to go. You don't need to do anything to the original application. The two applications do need to exist on the same account - you can't use this method to move a phone number between two different accounts.<br/>				   </p>

<h3>addressFindAll</h3>
<p>Sometimes you'll need to view all the addresses associated with a specific application. Using a GET on the addresses folder will provide you with the information you need; running a GET on a specific address type folder, such as addresses/number or addresses/aim, will get you a list of all the addresses that match that type for this application.<br/>					<br/>				   </p>

<h3>addressDelete</h3>
<p>You can remove a phone number, IM account or token from an application. If you remove a phone number, it will become available for use by someone else, so it's not recommended to delete a phone number unless you're absolutely sure you have no further need for it. If you want to move a phone number between applications, there's an easier way. Check out the Adding a Specific Number/Moving a Number> example for more info.<br/>					   </p>
