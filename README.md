APIS
====

All APIs implemented in Webshell are here in Javascript.

Usage
=====

in [Webshell](http://webshell.io/prototype), you can try all these APIs online in really few lines of code :

`apis.google.maps();`

This command will search in google folder, pick the last version and execute maps/maps file. 

If you have an account on [Webshell](http://webshell.io/), you can setup your API Key by creating an apps in your [Dashboard](http://webshell.io/dashboard). All settings needed are specified in the `conf.json` file which allow us to generate a form to let you set your API Keys.

Note
====

Some builtins are used in their APIs are not describe on Webshell.io yet... We work on it ;)
