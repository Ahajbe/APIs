The search request must include a searchloc value to set the geographic context for the search. The term value can include both name and category keywords. Note that if your implementation uses a single search box, you can combine geograpy and keywords in the term value and the API will parse them. This can potentially cause inaccurate matches if the business name includes place names, however. For example, the \"LA wine Company\" might be found in a search for \"wine+LA\" where LA is intended to mean Louisiana. Therefore, where possible, use the searchloc + term combination.","params":{"term":{"doc":"Unparsed, user-entered search term. Note: For applications where users may provide the search term and location in a single input field (e.g. pizza, Los Angeles), the user-entered value can be sent in the term parameter thus avoiding the need to parse the term and location on the client side.
