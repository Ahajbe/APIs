<h3>setServerSettings</h3>
<p>Sets the URL where we should send JSON data. In order for your application receive the emails that we parse, you will need to tell Postmark where to send the JSON data for each inbound email it processes, which is done via an HTTP POST to a URL of your choice. You can set this URL in the Settings page for your Postmark server in the web app, or using the InboundHookUrl field in the API. It also lets you choose a domain that you would like to listen on for incoming email to be processed by Postmark. We recommend a separate subdomain, like inbound.yourdomain.com. Each server can listen to one unique domain, so make sure to set the X-Postmark-Server-Token to the correct server token in the API call below.</p>
