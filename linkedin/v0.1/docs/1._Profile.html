You cannot use a member token to get a public profile. To see just a thumbnail version of the profile, do not include anything after the	profile key value. To select your own fields, use the field selector notation- :(field1,field2,field3...). When using field selectors, all fields must be at the same level of depth in the XML<br/>               </p>
