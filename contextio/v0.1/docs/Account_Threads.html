<h3>getAccountThread</h3>
<p>Returns files, contacts and messages on a given thread. The purpose is to allow Gmail extensions to easily retrieve data when users's load a conversation in the Gmail UI. Hence, threads are identified by the value of their Gmail thread prefixed with "gm-".<br/>For example, if the URL of a conversation in the Gmail UI is https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#mbox/13119ab37f00b826, you would obtain the details about this thread by calling:<br/>GET https://api.context.io/2.0/accounts/<accountId>/threads/gm-13119ab37f00b826<br/><br/>What about threads on non-Gmail mailboxes?<br/>You can retrieve thread information for any message using the Thread resource of that message.<br/>               </p>
