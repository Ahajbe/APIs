If the message was successfully delivered, the code field will always read 0; if the SMS could not be delivered, possibly due to exceeded rate limits or a bad phone number, there are a variety of additional codes to help you identify the problem.</td>

<h3>deliveryStatus</h3>
<p>If you want to check your delivery status before all your messages may have sent out (especially useful if you send an SMS to multiple addresses), you can pull a Delivery Status report using the requestId displayed in Response JSON. This is different than the other reporting options, as it functions in realtime - reporting only shows messages once they've successfully sent to the network or failed completely.<br/>	   </p>

			<td>notifyURL</td>
			<td>Instead of setting a callback URL using the notifyURL parameter every time you send a text message, you can set an outbound subscription. With a subscription, you set the callback URL one time and tie it to the phone number, then every time a text message goes out, you'll receive the delivery notification automatically. If you set a value for notifyURL when you send a text message and also have an active subscription, the delivery info will be sent to both URLs.</td>
