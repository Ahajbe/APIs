			<td>All API requests must specify a projection. Most developers who are using this documentation will use the api projection. However, if you are developing applications for mobile devices, you can substitute mobile for api in any of the sample requests described in the API documentation. Similarly, if you prefer to use the base projection, which is well suited to feed readers, you can substitute base for api in any of the sample requests described in the API documentation.<br/>			 </td>
