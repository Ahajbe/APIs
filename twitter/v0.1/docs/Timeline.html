<h1>Twitter API: Timeline</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Timeline'</p><h3>homeTimeline</h3>
<p>Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets and retweets posted by the authenticating user and the users they follow. The home timeline is central to how most users interact with the Twitter service.
                    Up to 800 Tweets are obtainable on the home timeline. It is more volatile for users that follow many users or follow users who tweet frequently.</p>

<h3>userTimeline</h3>

                    API version 1.1
                    Updated on Mon, 2012-10-15 07:23
                    Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by the user indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters.

                    User timelines belonging to protected users may only be requested when the authenticated user either "owns" the timeline or is an approved follower of the owner.

                    The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view a user's profile on twitter.com.

                    This method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent Tweets. Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total, regardless of whether include_rts is set to false when requesting this resource.</p>
