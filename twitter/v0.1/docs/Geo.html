<h1>Twitter API: Geo</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Geo'</p><h3>geoSearch</h3>
<p>Search for places that can be attached to a statuses/update. Given a latitude and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this request will return a list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a status.<br/><br/>Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of places, have the user validate the location he or she is at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to POST statuses/update.<br/><br/>This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to statuses/update. Unlike GET geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order places with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for interactive place matching with the user.</p>

<h3>geoSimilarPlaces</h3>
<p>Locates places near the given coordinates which are similar in name.<br/><br/>Conceptually you would use this method to get a list of known places to choose from first. Then, if the desired place doesn't exist, make a request to POST geo/place to create a new one.<br/><br/>The token contained in the response is the token needed to be able to create a new place.</p>

<h3>createPlace</h3>
<p>Creates a new place object at the given latitude and longitude.<br/><br/>Before creating a place you need to query GET geo/similar_places with the latitude, longitude and name of the place you wish to create.
