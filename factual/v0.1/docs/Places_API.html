<h3>match</h3>
<p>Match your data to Factual's.  The Factual Match endpoint will simply return the Factual ID of the data that matches your data; we return no data if we cannot identify your entity unequivocally.  If you require both the Factual ID and entity data for the place, see Resolve.<br/>               </p>

<h3>monetize</h3>
<p>The Monetize API enables you to access offers that Factual has aggregated from various third party offer originators (currently Groupon, LivingSocial, Yelp, GrubHub and Signpost) and earn money based on conversions.  The way it works is Factual snaps offers to Factual Places.  These offers and related places are exposed in the Monetize API, which is accessible through the same API structure as Factual's Core API.  As your users convert (i.e. purchase a deal, order from an online menu), Factual will relay to you a healthy commission from the third party offer originators.  To be clear, such payment is based on the actual conversions driven by a given developer.<br/>               </p>

<h3>resolve</h3>
<p>Resolve is an entity resolution API that makes partial records complete, matches one entity against another, and assists in de-duping and normalizing datasets. Resolve is designed to work with whatever you throw at it, but the more parameters you provide, the better we can resolve your attributes to an entity.<br/>               </p>
