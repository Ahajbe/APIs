<h1>Factual API: Core API</h1>
<p>These methods are relative to the tag 'Core API'</p><h3>read</h3>
<p>Reads rows of data from the specified table. Read requests may optionally include row filters, geo filters, and full-text-search filters as well offset/limit filters that can be used for paging. Specify any combination of full-text-search (q), geo, or row filters. Offset and limit are supported for paging. If you require a count of the total rows fitting our query, and don't mind incurring the performance cost, specify include_count=true. NOTE: If the filters, geo, or q parameters are declared and you pass a null value for any of those parameters your request will proceed as if those parameters were not passed at all.</p>

Supports $relevance as a sort option if a full text search is specified either using the q parameter or using the $search operator in the filter parameter.  By default, any query with a full text search will be sorted by relevance.  Any query with a geo filter will be sorted by distance from the reference point.  If both a geo filter and full text search are present, the default will be relevance followed by distance.</td>

<h3>facets</h3>
<p>Returns row counts for Factual tables, grouped by facets of the data.  For example, you may want to query all businesses within 1 mile of a location and for a count of those businesses by category. Not all fields are configured to return facet counts.  To determine what fields you can return facets for, use the schema call.  The faceted attribute of the schema will let you know. The facet API call is virtually identical to the read API call, except that it returns row counts (by facet) rather than rows of data.</p>
